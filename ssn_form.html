    <section>
        <strong>USE THIS APPLICATION TO:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Apply for an original Social Security card</li>
            <li>Apply for a replacement Social Security card</li>
            <li>Change or correct information on your Social Security number record</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>IMPORTANT: </strong>You MUST provide a properly completed application
            and the required evidence before we can process your application. We can only accept original documents
            or documents certified by the custodian of the original record. Notarized copies or photocopies which
            have not been certified by the custodian of the record are not acceptable. We will return any documents
            submitted with your application. For assistance call us at 1-800-772-1213 or visit our website at
            <a href="https://www.ssa.gov">www.socialsecurity.gov</a>.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Original Social Security Card</strong><br>To apply for an original
            card,
            you must provide at least two documents to prove age, identity, and U.S. citizenship or current lawful,
            work-authorized immigration status. If you are not a U.S. citizen and do not have DHS work
            authorization,
            you must prove that you have a valid non-work reason for requesting a card. See page 2 for an
            explanation
            of acceptable documents.<br><br>NOTE: If you are age 12 or older and have never received a Social
            Security
            number, you must apply in person.
        </p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Replacement Social Security Card</strong><br>To apply for a
            replacement card, you must provide one document to prove your identity. If you were born outside the
            U.S.,
            you must also provide documents to prove your U.S. citizenship or current, lawful, work- authorized
            status. See page 2 for an explanation of acceptable documents.</p>

        <p style="text-align:justify;"><strong>Changing Information on Your Social Security Record</strong><br>To
            change
            the information on your Social Security number record (i.e., a name or citizenship change, or
            corrected date of birth) you must provide documents to prove your identity, support the requested
            change,
            and establish the reason for the change. For example, you may provide a birth certificate to show your
            correct date of birth. A document supporting a name change must be recent and identify you by both your
            old
            and new names. If the name change event occurred over two years ago or if the name change document does
            not
            have enough information to prove your identity, you must also provide documents to prove your identity
            in
            your prior name and/or in some cases your new legal name. If you were born outside the U.S. you must
            provide
            a document to prove your U.S. citizenship or current lawful, work-authorized status. See page 2 for an
            explanation of acceptable documents.
        </p>

        <p>
        <center><u><strong>LIMITS ON REPLACEMENT SOCIAL SECURITY CARDS</strong></u></center>
        Public Law 108-458 limits the number of replacement Social Security cards you may receive to 3 per calendar
        year and 10 in a lifetime. Cards issued to reflect changes to your legal name or changes to a work
        authorization legend do not count toward these limits. We may also grant exceptions to these limits if you
        provide evidence from an official source to establish that a Social Security card is required.</p>

        <p>
        <center><u><strong>IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS</strong></u></center>

        <center><h3>EVIDENCE DOCUMENTS</h3></center>
        <p>The following lists are examples of the types of documents you must provide with your application and are
            not all inclusive. Call us at 1-800-772-1213 if you cannot provide these documents.</p>

        <p><strong>IMPORTANT : </strong>If you are completing this application on behalf of someone else, you must
            provide evidence that shows your authority to sign the application as well as documents to prove your
            identity and the identity of the person for whom you are filing the application. We can only accept
            original documents or documents certified by the custodian of the original record. Notarized copies
            or photocopies which have not been certified by the custodian of the record are not acceptable.</p>

        <p><strong>Evidence of Age</strong><br>In general, you must provide your birth certificate. In some
            situations, we may accept another document that shows your age. Some of the other documents we may
            accept are:
        <ul>
            <li>U.S. hospital record of your birth (created at the time of birth)</li>
            <li>Religious record established before age five showing your age or date of birth</li>
            <li>Passport</li>
            <li>Final Adoption Decree (the adoption decree must show that the birth information was taken from the
                original birth certificate)
            </li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p><strong>Evidence of Identity</strong>You must provide current, unexpired evidence of identity in your
            legal name. Your legal name will be shown on
            the Social Security card. Generally, we prefer to see documents issued in the U.S. Documents you submit
            to establish identity must show your legal name AND provide biographical information (your date of
            birth, age, or parents' names)
            <strong><u>and/or</u></strong>
            physical information (photograph, or physical description - height, eye and hair color, etc.). If you
            send a photo identity document but do not appear in person, the document must show your biographical
            information (e.g., your date of birth, age, or parents' names). Generally, documents without an
            expiration date should have been issued within the past two years for adults and within the past four
            years for children.<br>
            As proof of your identity, you must provide a:
        <ul>
            <li>U.S. driver's license; or</li>
            <li>U.S. State-issued non-driver identity card; or</li>
            <li>U.S. passport</li>
        </ul>
        If you do not have one of the documents above or cannot get a replacement within 10 work days, we may
        accept other documents that show your legal name and biographical information, such as a U.S. military
        identity card, Certificate of Naturalization, employee identity card, certified copy of medical record
        (clinic, doctor or hospital), health insurance card, Medicaid card, or school identity card/record. For
        young children, we may accept medical records (clinic, doctor, or hospital) maintained by the medical
        provider. We may also accept a final adoption decree, or a school identity card, or other school record
        maintained by the school.<br><br>
        If you are not a U.S. citizen, we must see your current U.S. immigration document(s) and your foreign
        passport with biographical information or photograph.<br><br>
        WE CANNOT ACCEPT A BIRTH CERTIFICATE, HOSPITAL SOUVENIR BIRTH CERTIFICATE, SOCIAL
        SECURITY CARD STUB OR A SOCIAL SECURITY RECORD as evidence of identity.
        </p>

        <p><strong>Evidence of U.S. Citizenship</strong><br>In general, you must provide your U.S. birth certificate
            or U.S. Passport. Other documents you may provide are a Consular Report of Birth, Certificate of
            Citizenship, or Certificate of Naturalization.</p>

        <p><strong>Evidence of Immigration Status</strong><br>You must provide a current unexpired document issued
            to you by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS)
            showing your immigration status, such as Form I-551, I-94, or I-766. If you are an international student
            or exchange visitor, you may need to provide additional documents, such as Form I-20, DS-2019, or a
            letter authorizing employment from your school and employer (F-1) or sponsor (J-1). We CANNOT accept a
            receipt showing you applied for the document. If you are not authorized to work in the U.S., we can
            issue you a Social Security card only if you need the number for a valid non-work reason. Your card will
            be marked to show you cannot work and if you do work, we will notify DHS. See page 3, item 5 for more
            information.
